# SpaceFight
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
<br>
It is a period of civil war. Rebel
spaceships, striking from a hidden
base, have won their first victory
against the evil Galactic Empire.
<br>
During the battle, Rebel spies managed
to steal secret plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, **the Red Sauce**, an
armored space station with enough
power to destroy an entire planet.
<br>
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
**You** races home aboard your
starship, custodian of the stolen plans
that can save your people and restore
freedom to the galaxy...
<br><br><br>
